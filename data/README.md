## Fabricated Splice Data ##

The script `fabricate_data.py` creates fabricated splice data.

+ _don_ means donor site
+ _acc_ means acceptor site
+ _obs_ means looks like observed site
+ _not_ means looks like not observed site
+ _ex#_ means experiment number (see below)

The following command was used to generate data (2021-01-04)

	python3 fabricate_data.py --seed 1
	gzip acc.*.fa don.*.fa

## Experiment Numbers ##

The base donor concensus is GTrrg. That means that the GT will be
produced 100% of the time and the other letters will follow purine,
purine, guanine with some mismatches allowed (see code).

+ ex1 - donor sites where the rrg is AAg or GGg (perfect A and G)
+ ex2 - donor sites where the rrg is aag or ggg (as above but imperfect)

The base acceptor concensus is tttcAG. The AG is produced 100% of the
time, but the other positions allow mismatches.

+ ex3 - acceptor sites with TTTC or CTTT (perfect)
+ ex4 - acceptor sites with tttc or cttt (imperfect)
+ ex5 - acceptor sites with TTNC or NTTC (perfect, but slides 1 bp)
+ ex6 - acceptor sites with ttNc or Nttc (as above, but imperfect)

## Exon Data ##

51 bp each. Generation script is in lyman2020.

1. CDS anchored at ATG (cdsi.fa.gz)
2. CDS anchored at phase 0 (cds0.fa.gz)
3. CDS any frame, but + strand (cds+.fa.gz)
4. CDS any frame, but - strand (cds-.fa.gz)
